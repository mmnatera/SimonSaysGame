 FreeCodeCamp Project.
Requirements: use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style. User is presented with a random series of button presses. Each time user inputs a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step. User hears a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when user presses a button. If user presses the wrong button, user is notified that it has done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind user of the pattern so he/she can try again. User can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses. If user wants to restart, he/she can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step. User can play in strict mode where if he/she gets a button press wrong, it notifies user that he/she have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses. User can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. User is notified of victory, then the game starts over.
